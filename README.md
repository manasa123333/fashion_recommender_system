# Introduction
This project is a Fashion Recommender System built using classic machine learning and deep learning techniques. It suggests fashion items to users based on their preferences and browsing history.
I developed a fashion recommender system utilizing ResNet, leveraging the power of transfer learning. The model extracts 2048-dimensional feature vectors from input images. I then used Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface where users can upload an image. This image is processed by ResNet to extract features, and recommendations are generated using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

# Features
Personalized Recommendations: Offers tailored fashion recommendations.
User Interaction: Allows users to input their preferences.
Fashion Dataset: Utilizes a curated fashion dataset.
Real-time Suggestions: Provides instant recommendations as users interact with the system.
